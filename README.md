## Bonjour :)

I'm Pablo Sastre-Garau, a recent graduate with a dual degree from a business school and an engineering school. Since September 2024, I've been working as a Data & AI Engineer at CGI.

I've always been passionate about technology, but also about sports and health. Iâ€™d like to contribute to these industries by building tools that improve performance, prediction, and decision-making. I'm especially interested in how data and AI can support athletes, coaches, and health professionals.

On this GitHub, I share personal projects, prototypes, and experiments : from data pipelines and machine learning models to AI-powered apps and cloud workflows. This space reflects my journey to keep improving as a developer, data engineer, and AI practitioner.

Feel free to explore, connect, or reach out. I'm always happy to learn from others and share ideas !
